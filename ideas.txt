Maping:
can make a variable to check if its active and put it in NEW to constantly check if the variable has been 
changed to false and while its true it shows the map but when alse it hides the map.

GUI:
add a GUI
- hotbar of items
- indicators that show keybinds like inventory
- healhbar
- stamina bar

inventory:
make and inventory keybind and when the keybind is clicked it opens invetory
make the inventory interactable to drag and move items

items:
give every item a value from 0000 to 9999 as will most likely not need more but will leave room for future updates
assine damage values and damage scaling and create a damage scaling calculation linked to weapon stats

food:
add food that heals your hp at set value depending on how it is cooked and how well it is done
add food that regens your stamina at a set value depending on how it is cooked and how well it is done
add food that regens stamina over time faster at set value depending on how it is cooked and how well it is done
add food that regens hp over time at set value depending on how it is cooked and how well it is done

Bosses:
add boss domains that when enetered the boss can tp around and unleash attacks
add encounter bosses within the world
add sea bosses that have a rare chance to spawn while in dangerouse sea areas

File saving:
as saving will most likely be linked to files, encription will be needed to encript and decript save files to reduce the
chance of being tampered with
figure out wether i want backpacks to increase inventry or increase with strength stat and find the max possible ammount of
storage from the system and from this using item values store everything in a line down untill the max inventry space
everything stored like e.g.
- 00 - level
- 1563 - level exp
- 50 - max hp
- 34 - current hp
- 0023 - item ID
- 0342 - item ID
- 0324 - item ID
- 0326 - item ID
-  - item ID
-  - item ID
-  - item ID
-  - item ID
- 0435 - talent ID
- 0056 - talent ID
this is not what it will look like most likely
